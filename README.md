## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS Grid, as this was my first time trying it out in a project. It was so cool to view my grids using Firefox devtools, and it was a fun challenge to mix flex and grid layouts to achieve this project's resposive designs.

I also learned that after and before pseudo-elements do not apply to replaced elements like img (source: https://css-tricks.com/7-practical-uses-for-the-before-and-after-pseudo-elements-in-css/). It took a while for me to get the orange overlay working on top of the phone-and-keyboard image, but I was able to do so by applying after styles to the containing div.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working on my CSS Grid skills, as well as furthering my understanding of semantic HTML and CSS best practices.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid by Wes Bos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG) - I watched this YouTube video series created by Wes Bos in order to learn the fundamentals of CSS Grid, and I really recommend it! Wes's explanations are clear and easy to follow, and the videos are split into small, manageable chunks.
